# MSU Denver Computer Science

Aimed at giving students a useful place to go to for learning resources, this is a compilation of things I personally found to be helpful in my own self-guided learning and would like to share.

## New To Programming

- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (MIT)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) - Ths course is aimed at teaching students how to use their computers. [Something often overlooked in CS curriculum](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/about/), it gives them a hands-on introduction to tools they will use in a variety of situations such as their command-line environment and version control with Git.
- [Harvard University's CS50](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381L3iZyDTxRwOBuUt6m1FnW) - Harvard's CS50 Course is a great way to learn the basics of programming, with each class introducing the learner to a different programming language in order to solve problems, starting with Scratch and ending with JavaScript.
- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/) - This website offers beginner-friendly tutorials on a variety of programming languages with examples.

## Python Programming Resources

- [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/featured) - Courses for Python and other Python related topics on YouTube.
- [Programiz - Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming)

## Java Programming Resources

- [Java Programming Tutorial, Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-xAqcBCws4) - This is a two hour long video tutorial that should get you started with the Java programming language.
- [Programiz - Java](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming)

## Apply Your Knowledge - Problem Solving

- [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) - Community backed and open source, Exercism is a great place to learn and get feedback on solving problems. They offer the ability to work on solving problems with or without a mentor and it has the added benefit of being done through a command line tool.
- [Codingbat](https://codingbat.com/) - A great place to start if you're not used to solving coding challenges, with the ability to do so in both Java and Python.

### The Community

- [Denver Devs](https://www.denverdevs.org/) - A Slack channel dedicated to Denver's tech community. Focused on helping each other find jobs, solve problems, make friends, and much more.
- MSUD Computer Science Discord Channel (TBA)
