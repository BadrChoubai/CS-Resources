# CS Resource

This page lists resources that as a student, I've found useful for extra guidance,
self-paced learning and getting involved in the local technology community.

## Beginning Programming

1. `$PATH` or `%PATH%` variable [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable))
2. Installing Packages from the Command-Line:
    - MacOS [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage) - `brew` command
    - Ubuntu [Advanced Packaging Tool (APT)](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/package-management) - `apt` command
3. [Harvard CS50](https://www.edx.org/cs50)
4. [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (MIT)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu) - A course not traditionally offered
   in Computer Science programs about the tools you'll use the most.
